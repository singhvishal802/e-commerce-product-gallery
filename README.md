# ECommerce App

A modern mobile e-commerce application built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) and TypeScript. This app provides a seamless shopping experience with product browsing, detailed product information, shopping cart functionality, and more.

## Features

- **Product Gallery**: Browse a curated selection of products with beautiful image carousels
- **Product Details**: View detailed information about each product including images, descriptions, and pricing
- **Shopping Cart**: Add products to cart with persistent state management using Zustand
- **Navigation**: Smooth navigation between screens using React Navigation
- **Vector Icons**: Beautiful icons powered by Ionicons
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support for type safety and better developer experience

## Tech Stack

- **React Native** (v0.84.0) - Mobile framework
- **React** (v19.2.3) - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **React Navigation** - Screen navigation and routing
- **Zustand** - State management for cart
- **React Native Reanimated** - Advanced animations
- **Ionicons** - Icon library

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v22.11.0 or higher)
- React Native development environment set up ([guides](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup))
- Ruby and CocoaPods (for iOS development on macOS)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

2. For iOS, install CocoaPods dependencies:

```bash
bundle install
cd ios
bundle exec pod install
cd ..
```

### Running the App

#### Start Metro (JavaScript build tool)

```bash
yarn start
# or
npm start
```

#### Run on iOS

```bash
yarn ios
# or
npm run ios
```

#### Run on Android

```bash
yarn android
# or
npm run android
```

## Available Scripts

- `yarn start` - Start the Metro dev server
- `yarn ios` - Build and run on iOS simulator
- `yarn android` - Build and run on Android emulator/device
- `yarn test` - Run tests with Jest
- `yarn lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality

## Development

### Making Changes

Changes made to the code are automatically reflected with Hot Reload (powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh)).

To force a full reload:
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in the simulator
- **Android**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> twice or select "Reload" from the dev menu (<kbd>Ctrl ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd>)

### Code Style

The project uses ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting. Run the lint command to check for issues:

```bash
yarn lint
```

## Testing

Run the test suite with Jest:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Metro issues**: Clear cache with `yarn start --reset-cache`
- **iOS build errors**: Try clearing iOS build folder: `rm -rf ios/Pods ios/Podfile.lock && bundle exec pod install`
- **Android issues**: Clear Android build with `./android/gradlew clean`

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
